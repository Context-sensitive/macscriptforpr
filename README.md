# macscript
macscript is a script which makes installing palera1n,checkra1n,odysseyra1n and installing apt on macos easy!

just run this oneliner in your terminal!

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsmaclol/macscript/main/macscript.sh)"`

PS: do NOT use the script on [my cdn](https://cdn.planks.ml/scripts) because it is BROKEN and very OLD

GUI and macn1x (iso version of my script) coming very soon!
